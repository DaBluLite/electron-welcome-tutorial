## I made this app just as a proof of concept that a 15 Year old boy can write good nodejs and electron apps. You can use this code for whatever you want ;)

You need node.js to run this project.

#### Command line:

```
git clone https://github.com/DaBluLite/electron-welcome-tutorial.git

cd electron-welcome-tutorial/

npm i

npm start
```
